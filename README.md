This project uses the map powered by leaflet.js and uses the ISS api to update the location of the International Space Station every 5 seconds on the map.
Key Features:
- The map is powered by Leaflet.js.
- The ISS's location is fetched from the API every 5 seconds.
- A custom icon (ISS logo) is used to represent the ISS on the map.
- The map automatically centers on the ISS's new location as it moves across the Earth.
